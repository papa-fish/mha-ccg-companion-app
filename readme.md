## Introduction

Welcome to the MHA Companion App, your go-to tool for enhancing your My Hero Academia Collectible Card Game (MHA CCG) experience! This mobile app is built using React Native and is designed to streamline matches in the MHA CCG.

As a developer, I embarked on this project with no previous experience in mobile development, specifically learning React Native for this purpose. This journey has been a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to share this app with the MHA CCG community.

The MHA Companion App will soon be available on both the App Store and Google Play Store, making it easily accessible to a wide range of users.

You can check out more of my projects and contact me on my [portfolio](https://lukemoore.au).

## Features

- **Match Management:** Easily manage matches for the MHA CCG, helping you keep track of current and maximum hp, damage, zone, and speed of incoming attacks, incoming damage from unblocked and half blocked attacks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features an intuitive and user-friendly design. Split into 2 screens, making it easy for both players to quickly analyze the match information without having to read anything upside-down. This interface makes it easy for players of all levels to use!
- **Cross-Platform:** Soon to be available on both the App Store and Google Play Store, accessible to iOS and Android users.
